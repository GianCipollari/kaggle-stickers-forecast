## About me  

Hello! First of all, thank you for taking the time to review this repository.  
My name is Gianfranco Cipollari and I am a data analysis and machine learning enthusiast.  
I come from a career in public accounting, but due to a personal experience with an illness,  
I questioned whether I was really doing something I was passionate about.  

I decided to reinvent myself and embark on the world of data analysis, a field that I find challenging,  
interesting and with a significant impact. This project is part of my learning path  
and it is one of the ones I am developing to build my portfolio with the aim of getting my first job  
as Data Analyst.  

I hope you find value in this work and any feedback is welcome!
